# Description 

This weeks Challenege is based around Bootstrap and how it makes life easier by not having to write your own code and use libraries to help. bootstrap makes it easier to allow the front end to look visually better.
I have implemented various Bootstrap components to create sections like the navigation bar, hero section (jumbotron), work section with Bootstrap cards, skills section, about/contact section, and a footer. This site is completley Responsive and i have also factored in individuals who use screen readers by applying HTML semantics to each section that require it.
